Including risks and issues is important but not all the risks and issues. And including resource usage for benefits delivery is a closer choice.

Escalated issues as raised by component managers which are critical to program should be first analyzed and attempted to resolve at program level. If you can easily get the issue fixed at program level then you may decide not to include such issue to the report and instead may decide to include it in separate status summary report.

Preparing different drafts for different stakeholders based on information required by them makes sense but not too practical.

Getting issues prioritized is always helpful. Impact analysis techniques take it to another level by understanding the urgency and probability of each issue, which then will help easily prioritize the issues. So directly trying to prioritize the issues without knowing more about the issues is not the best option at this point.

Program stakeholders expectations should be part of the program objectives, but that may not be the case always. Such as in the given scenario. There is a gap. Gap due to not collecting stakeholder expectations during program definition phase.

Program stakeholders wouldn't know if their expectations are well captured by the program management or not. It is program manager's responsibility to collect the stakeholder expectations and plan the program accordingly. So even though now program is executed accordingly to program manager, it still can't be closed due to open critical expectations from stakeholders.

Program stakeholder expectations are not program objectives until program management team identifies and captures their expectations as program objectives. If certain stakeholders are not identified or engaged, then their expectations may be missed out to be included in list of program objectives.

Developing relationship with stakeholders is a good practice and shouldn't be avoided. Although indulging in activities of developing relationship with all the stakeholders is not a practical approach. Especially when there are huge number of stakeholders in program.

Establishing stakeholder map is useful and should be performed once stakeholders are identified and being analyzed further. Although stakeholder map doesn't outline HOW negative stakeholders can be transformed into positive or neutral stakeholders. Instead, it identifies which stakeholders need to be transformed from what category to what category.
